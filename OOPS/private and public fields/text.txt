By default the methods pof the classes are accessible to the user, in js around 4-5 years there are no method to hide the property of the classes
so developr used to add __ double underscore or single underscore to the property just to tell it is a private property do not access it ouside, but it's not strictly restricted

so to make a property private we need to age # before the property name and we need to write that name before constructor

when we create a object directly and try to make some property private in it using # it will through an error but we can use ['#property'] but doint that also will not make it private as we can access it using the same syntax in the console
