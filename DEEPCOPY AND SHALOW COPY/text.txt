Shallow Copy : copying an array and object using spread operator, object.assign concat etc method will create a new array and object respectively,
but when we have nested object or a array nested nside a object then the shallow copy did not work as shallow copy copies an object only in one level
i.e. the outer object and array, Changes in nested objects affect the original, shallow copy is faster then deep copy


DeepCopy : Recursively copies all properties, any change in the copy objet or array wont change the original  object or array 

method to deep copy JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()), structuredClone()


use shallow copy when your data contains only premitive value
use DeepCopy when your data contains jon premitive value like nested aary or object
